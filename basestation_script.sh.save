#Script to be run by the basestation receiving the signal
#This script does the following
#Recives 3 UDP streams from the splitterscript
#processes these with gnuradio selecting the signal with highest power
#  and then runs it through a WBFM converter sending audio to udp://localhost:7355
#netcat pipes the audio to alsa that plays it on a loopback device that fmpeg can read
#ffmpeg creates 5 second snippets of the audio for processing
#		TODO!!!!
#noaa-apt (insert git link) processes these to a image slice that will be stiched together creating a live display.


sudo modprobe snd-aloop
nc -l -u 7355 | aplay -r 11025 -f S16_LE -t raw -c 1 -D hw:1,0,1
#change this to a stable python script later
